# Abstract

*Regeneration is a key process in forest dynamics. Models of forest
dynamics have been long lagging an assessment in their capacities to
properly represent this process. Using 13 models of forest dynamics at
the stand, landscape and global levels, we simulate the regeneration
across 200 sites representing environmental gradients across Europe. The
outputs were compared with regeneration data collected from forest
reserves across Europe. In this study we wanted to asses how well are
models of forest dynamics capturing regeneration levels and what can be
changed to improve this. The results show that most of the models
over-estimate regeneration values. However most of them got right trends
in regeneration across temperature and precipitation gradients. Stand
species richness was better capture than recruitment species richness.

# Introduction

Tree recruitment is fundamental for forest dynamics, in particular with
increasing disturbance under climate change and it is also crucial
understand the forest resilience under climate change.

In comparison to recruitment, growth and mortality [@bugmann2019]
responses to climate change are much more studied

Tree recruitment depends on multiple processes (reproduction, fruit
maturation, seed production, dispersal, germination, juvenile growth and
survival) that are all difficult to assess

Models are needed to (1) synthesize existing empirical data and explore
their consequences, and (2) assess future tree recruitment e.g. in the
context of global change scenarios

Regeneration processes in dynamic forest models and how they have been
handled to date [@konig_tree_2022; @bugmann2022].

Tendency of models to be too liberal with recruitment; consequences of
over-recruitment Species richness in regeneration, mortality and
regeneration levels may have strong impacts on forest dynamics

An analysis how well models of forest dynamics perform re. recruitment
is lacking. This is the first time, a large number of forest models
commonly used to assess forest dynamics under climate change is
evaluated against a continental-scale multi-species harmonized data set
on tree recruitment. Briefly praise the dataset [@käber].

In this study wanted to answer the following questions: 1) Are models of
forests dynamics capturing correctly regeneration levels across
environmental gradients 2) Are models of forest dynamics representing
correctly initial composition of tree populations 3) Can models of
forest dynamics correctly capture the initial mortality in tree
in-growth between 7 and 10 cm

# Material and methods

## The models

Fifteen models of forest dynamics (including two model variants) were
used to assess tree regeneration. The models varied on their scale
including models at the stand, landscape and global scale (see Table
\@ref(tab:tableModels)). Their model construction philosophies and
origin also differs with two models where their formulations were
derived using statistical analyses based on inventory data (SYBILA and
xComp) and others with largely process based approach. Some of the
models largely rely on the original approach underlying forest gap
models (ForClim 1, ForClim 11, LandClim, Landis II ); and some include
plant ecophysiology formulations (FORMIND, PICUS, 4C, iLand). This
different approaches in the models construction also has influence how
regeneration is defined.

The models can be categorized as regeneration models and recruitment (or
ingrowth) models [@vanclay1994, @konig_tree_2022]. Regeneration models
include in their regeneration modules processes such as flowering and
pollination, seed production, seed dispersal, germination or seedling
establishment that lead to the number of seedlings or saplings.
Recruitment models introduce a number of seedlings or saplings with
certain characteristic (biomass or dbh) without considering earlier
development processes. We can also distinguish models that have feedback
in the regeneration as those in which the level and species composition
in regeneration is influenced by the existing adult tree community, this
can be done via the production of seed, seedlings or saplings. The
starting point for regeneration it was also different per model varying
from seedbank, seed, sapling and ingrowth. The overall complexity in the
regeneration modules also varied, following @bugmann2022 we can see that
most of the models have rather low/high? complexity while few of them
have high/low?. Further details on the models specific formulation
related to their regeneration modules and an overall summary across
models is presented in the supplementary materials.

e used repeated tree census data collected in forest reserves and
unmanaged (or protected) forests across Europe, 127 which were compiled
in the framework of the EuFoRIa network.

The sampled forests have not been managed for 128 at least one decade,
but most for much longer, and some are primary forests.

The final data set contained 701 units, each covering on average 1 ha of
forest area with 142 observations of tree recruitment at a DBH of 7 cm
(see

aggregated

## The observed data

Regeneration observations for a wide range of environmental gradients
are hard to obtain and this is one of the reasons why most of the models
of forest dynamics have never been confronted with a data-set covering a
wide range of regeneration sites across climate gradients to evaluate
how well are they capturing regeneration.

The observed data represent the available range of environmental
gradients in temperature and precipitation from 200 sites of strict
forest reserves in Europe compiled in the framework of the EuFoRIa
network. The sample forest have not been managed in at least 10 years,
and each of the sites contains at least two consecutive measurements.
Regeneration was measured at 7 and 10 cm threshold, however 35 sites
only contain information for 10 cm diameter. The 200 sites represent the
available climatic gradients of temperature and precipitation across
Europe and they varied in species composition (Figure \@ref(fig:map)).
For more information on this dataset and their regeneration please refer
to @kaber_sheltered_nodate.

## Simulation protocol

Each modeler group was provided with detailed protocol (available in the
supplementary material) on how to perform the simulations regarding
input variables such as climate or soil, simulation setup and expected
output variables. No information was provided on the regeneration on
these sites before the models performed were done. The overarching goal
of this simulations was the assessment of the regeneration niche as it
arises from empirical data analysis against its representation in a wide
range of models of forest dynamics.

The input variables were collected and aggregated to be adapted to the
different model demands. The time series of climatic variables from 1981
to 2018 were provided in hourly (Era5-land data @muñozsabater ), daily
and monthly resolution (CHELSA data, @karger ). Some variables required
for some models such as relative humidity or vapor pressure deficit had
to be calculated from these variables. The final use of the climate data
was different in each model (Table \@ref(tab:tableModels))The soil
quality data was provided as a continuous value between 1 and 5
(Soilgrids dataset, @hengl2017, @poggio2021 ). Elevation, slope and
aspect was also provided for each of the 200 sites, however no other
spatial information such as coordinates were provided (@astergd ).

The simulations had to be run in the absence of natural disturbances,
however one the model LPJ-GUESS had to include HERE LPJ-GUESS PROVIDE
[ONE SENTENCE]{.underline} OF WHY YOU INCLUDED DISTURBANCES AND WHAT
TYPE. The simulations had to be set up in a way that they will obtain
samples on species specific regeneration rates per decade and per ha.
The modeling teams decided on the simulated area and how they derive
these samples (further details on how each modeling team prepared the
simulations are available in the supplementary material).

The simulations were run from bare ground in the absence of management
to a simulated equilibrium (\"potential natural vegetation\") with the
current climate. The goal was to derive the regeneration niche.The
regeneration niche is defined as the passing of a diameter threshold of
7 and 10 cm (ingrowth; cf. below). Both the width of the regeneration
niche (i.e., in environmental space) as well as the intensity of the
recruitment process (i.e., the number of ingrowth trees per area and per
unit of time) are of interest. The exact length of the simulation should
was decided by the modeling teams (Table \@ref(tab:tableModels)).

The simulations were run for mixed species forests (not multiple
single-species simulations) using mixtures of the following
species/genera: *Fagus sylvatica, Picea abies, Abies alba, Carpinus
betulus, Tilia cordata, Acer pseudoplatanus, Betula spp., Fraxinus
excelsior, Quercus spp., Alnus glutinosa, Pinus sylvestris.* Three
models included additional species in the simulations (ForClim 1,
ForClim 11 and TreeMig) and three could not simulate all the species
(4C, xComp, TreeMig, LPJ-GUESS). HERE **FORCLIM** PROVIDES [ONE
SENTENCE]{.underline} WHY IT SIMULATED MORE SPECIES. HERE **TREEMIG**
PROVIDES [ONE SENTENCE]{.underline} WHY IT SIMULATED MORE SPECIES AND
MISSED ONE. HERE **4C** PROVIDES [ONE SENTENCE]{.underline} WHY IT
SIMULATED LESS SPECIES. HERE **XCOMP** PROVIDES [ONE
SENTENCE]{.underline} WHY IT SIMULATED LESS SPECIES. The model aDGVM2
did not have species level option and provided the default approach with

The simualtion have to be provided for two diameter thresholds: 7 and 10
cm.

There are 35 sites that had a diameter threshold of 10 cm and therefore
we do not know the actual recruitment rates for those sites at 7 cm; yet
the models simulated recruitment for the 7 cm threshold on those sites.
The 35 sites were removed from the simulated data as well to make a fair
comparison.

How many species were simulated per model? why?

Need to say something about zero inflation in the observations vs. the
simulations (current Figure S5)

## Analysis

A GAM model based on XXX was used to compare the trend on the observed
data and the simulated outputs. DESCRIBE GAM

Species simulated: 4C only simulated 4 species. Treemig. ForClim and
Observed data have more species assigned all together into category
"others". LPJ-GUESS simulated bushes that were not consider in the
output of speces composition neither recruitment.

ToDo add a map with the species composition of the observed data

ToDo check in Haralds paper which models are in which category in the
classification of establishment and link this with the results we see
here in structure and complexity. For example iLand and Picus have a
similar structure but results are very different. Are we meeting the
expectations in behaviour fromthe different models?

Species composition in regeneration

We evaluated the species compositions across models and in relation to
the observed data by calculating the Shannon index that defines the
relative frequency of species referring to basal area (BA) (Equation
@ref(eq:shannon))

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
H_n = - \sum_{i = 1}^{s}{p_{i}ln(p_{i})}(\#eq:shannon)
\end{equation}
```
```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
p_{n,i} = \frac{BA_{r_{n,i}}}{BA_{total_{n}}}(\#eq:piShannon)
\end{equation}
```
where, $s$ is the total number of species in the sample $n$ (11 for the
models that simulated all the species and a varied number for those
models that did not consider all the species (see Table
@ref(tab:tableModels) for more details in the simulated species);
$p_{i}$ is the proportion of the species $i$ calculated as the recruited
basal area ($BA_{r_{n,i}}$) for that species $i$ over the total basal
area ($BA_{total_{n}}$) of that sample $n$.

Main hypothesis:

The recruitment species richness is driven by the simulated adult trees
species richness and this is defined on how models represent individual
species recruitment per site with respect of adult proportion

Environmental gradients have an impact on the recruitment of the 5 main
tree species but extremes are not well captured

Models can capture the relative abundance of recruitment of the 5 main
European tree species but they are not doing a good job for minor
species

We evaluate the species composition in the recruitment and for all the
trees present on the site using the relative frequency of species
referring to basal area with the Shannon index calculated per sample,
site and model. The higher the value, the higher the diversity of
species in a particular site and sample.

Mortality in recruitment

Main hypothesis:

the higher regeneration at threshold of 7cm the stronger is the
regeneration mortality, so we will see a larger decease in stem number
between recruitment at threshold of 7 cm and 10 cm (as ratio nn7/nn10
(colname nn710))  In othwr words the number of individuals would
decrease (Reineke self-thinning rule: This is usually calculated from
even age, single species stands. The models could also include the
effects of canopy shading and species competition)

Species composition it is also reduced between 7 and 10 cm

Comments on the Reineke rule

the number of individuals would decrease (Reineke self-thinning rule)
from 7 to 10cm

assumes a relationship between the number of stems and the quadratic
mean diameter in fully stocked pure stands.

This rule is extensively used for management purposes, but it has been
initially calibrated for pure, even-aged stands for relatively few
species.

This is usually calculated from even age, single species stands. The
models could also include the effects of canopy shading and species
competition.

Explanations:

$$Reineke exp rk=-1.605: (7/10)^{(-1.605)} = 1.77$$

# Results

## Recruitment levels

Results related to regeneration levels, species composition and
mortality in recruitment varied across models and in comparison with the
observations. As expected, recruitment was overestimated across most
models for both the 7 and 10 cm diameter thresholds, with the exception
of SYBILA, Landis II and aDGVM2 that estimated recruitment rates at the
lower end of the plausibility interval of the observed data (Figure
\@ref(fig:over)). The models with highest overestimation were PICUS and
TreeMig. For most of the models, the variability across sites in
recruitment levels (visible from the interquartile range in the box
plots of Figure \@ref(fig:over)) is similar to or smaller than the
observed variability for most of the models, with the exception of
PICUS, where the mean recruitment variability is much larger.

```{r over, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Mean recruitment values across all samples for the 200 sites. The red dotted lines shows the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles for the 7 cm diameter threshold.", out.width='100%'}
        knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures", "recOverAll710.png"))
```

When looking at the representation of recruitment rates along key
gradients of light availability (basal area), temperature (degree-days)
and soil moisture (water balance), distinct features emerge: the models
reproduce the effect of basal area much better than the effects of
climatic gradients, where they feature varying effects (Figure
\@ref(fig:nvTrend710BA) and FigureS 1-4).

In the observed data the pattern shows that with increasing stand basal
area recruitment decreases. However, this trend was captured by Landis
II only, albeit at much lower values of basal area than in the
observations. Other models featured distinctly different trends, such as
(1) an increase in regeneration with increasing total basal area
followed of no recruitment at high basal area (ForCEEPS, ForCEEPS(f),
FORMIND, TreeMig and LPJ-GUESS), (2) almost constant regeneration levels
with basal area (ForClim 11, xComp, LandClim and aDGVM2) or (3) an
increase of recruitment up to a certain value of stand basal area
followed by a decrease of recruitment at even higher stand basal area
values at model-specific thresholds (4C, ForClim 1, PICUS, SYBILA and
iLand).

Models did not match the observed patterns in recruitment across soil
moisture and temperature gradients and there was either a clear common
pattern across models. Looking at the soil moisture gradients (FigureS
2), we can see that a group of models decreases recruitment with
increasing soil moisture (4C, ForClim 1, ForClim11, SIBYLA, xComp, PICUS
and LandClim), while few models had the opposite trend (ForCEEPs(f),
FORMIND and LPJ-GUESS). Across temperature gradients all the models that
had a decrease in recruitment with increasing soil moisture showed the
opposite trend (more recruitment with increasing temperature) except for
4C (FigureS 3). The rest of the models did not have a clear pattern
across the temperature gradient.

                              here::here("figures", "envTrend7Totba_500.png")))
```

## Species composition in recruitment

Most of the models match the level of diversity (as measured by the
Shannon index) of the observed data quite well (Figure \@ref(fig:H710)),
although they consistently underestimate its variability across sites.
Four models overestimate recruitment diversity:4C, PICUS, LANDIS-II and
LPJ-GUESS, the latter mostly for the 10 cm diameter threshold. The model
4C is a special case as this model simulated 5 species only. In most
models there are small differences across sites regarding the species
richness of recruitment between 7 and 10 cm. Most models maintain the
recruitment diversity between the 7 and 10 cm thresholds, and the same
is visible from the observed data, there are only few models where the
recruitment diversity increases between 7 and 10 cm which might be an
artifact of the sample strategy and calculating the Shannon index based
in BA as for a same sample recruitment at 10cm will include larger trees
with larger BA and if those are from different species, the Shannon
index will be larger.

```{r H710, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Shannon index of the recruitment, calculated by basal area as the mean value across samples per site for the diameter thresholds of 7 and 10 cm, respectively. The red dotted lines represent the 20th percentile of the observed data for the threshold of 7 cm and the 70th percentile of the observed data for the threshold of 10 cm.", out.width='100%'}
    knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures", "H7_10.png"))
```

Most of the models are capturing well or over-predicting the species
richness at the stand level (Figure \@ref(fig:combinedRichness) A2 and
FigureS 6). The models over predicting species richness at the stand
level are ForClim1, ForClim 11, FORMIND and TreeMig (Figure
\@ref(fig:combinedRichness) A1). However only few models under-predict
the species richness at the stand level (Figure
\@ref(fig:combinedRichness) A3) LPJ-GUESS, ForCEEPS (f), xComp, iLand
and 4C. Species diversity is lower in the recruitment compared to the
stand level, for both observed and simulated data, and for both
recruitment thresholds, i.e. 7 and 10 cm (Figure
\@ref(fig:combinedRichness)B, and FigureS 7). The majority of the models
capture reasonably well the recruitment diversity at lower values of
diversity, however most of them strongly underestimate species diversity
in recruitment for higher observed diversity levels. Models simulating
higher diversity at the stand level do not feature higher diversity in
recruitment (FigureS 6 and 7). Both models with feedback and without
feedback from the adult trees (via seed production) underestimate
species richness in recruitment.

```

Silver fir (*Abies alba*), beech (*Fagus sylvatica*), Scots pine (*Pinus
sylvestris*) and oaks (*Quercus* spp) were the most frequent species in
the observed data. Most models capture the share of basal area of
recruitment of the five main tree species compared to the observed data
along the two major gradients of climate (Figure \@ref(fig:diff) and
FigureS XX). However, the models differ in the way they represent the
climate niche of individual main species. First, some models
overestimated recruitment across the whole gradient for one of the 5
main tree species (for example, ForCEEPS, ForCEEPS(f),LandClim or
LPJ-GUESS), while other models overestimated recruitment for more than
one species for larger parts of the climate gradient, such as xComp,
PICUS , SYBILA or LPJ-GUESS (cf. red colors in Figure \@ref(fig:diff)).
This trends were consistent with those when the regeneration thresholds
was at 7 and 10cm although the exact changes in recruited basal area
share changed (FigureS XX).

When looking individually to each of the five main tree species it is
possible to observe differences in the simulated recruitment results.
Silver fir (*Abies alba*) was well captured across the gradient by most
models except for xComp, Picus, LandClim and Landis-II, which
overestimated its recruitment share. There are also some particularities
evident for some models, such as 4C that did not simulate *Abies alba*.
*Fagus sylvatica* was underestimated by many models across the
environmental gradient, including ForCEEPS(f) and FORMIND that did not
have regeneration in most of the sites for this species. Most of the
models over-estimated *Picea abies* recruitment share on colder sites.
*Pinus sylvestris* and *Quercus* spp. represented a smaller share of the
recruited species in the observed data and localized on certain areas of
the environmental gradient, however many models did have recruitment for
these two species in most of the climatic gradient although at basal
area share. Five models (4C, FORMIND, SYBILA, xComp, LandClim) had
almost no generation or did not regenerate *Pinus sylvestris* and
*Quercus* spp.

It is important to keep in mind that the values shown in Figure
\@ref(fig:diff) are the means of all samples per site, and the mean
across the sites in each environmental bin. In this figure we are seeing
together two types of zeros (represented with a lack of dots in the
corresponding tile), the first type of zero are those sites where the
recruited basal area of the species was zero and the stand recruited
basal area for all species was also zero, those were considered as zero
BA share; the second type of zeros are those sites where there was no
recruitment for that species but there was recruitment for other
species.

## Mortality in regeneration

There are strong differences across models on the mortality rate between
7 and 10 cm (Figure \@ref(fig:mortality11)). All models except for the
two DGVMs LPJ-GUESS and aDGVM2 feature a mortality rate larger than the
observed data, thus at least partially compensating for the general
overestimation of recruitment rates (Figure \@ref(fig:over)). Some of
the models showed strong compensation for the initial overestimation of
recruitment with larger mortality of recruitment between 7 and 10 cm
thresholds but not in others. On the one hand, models below the Reineke
line have lower mortality than expected by the self-thinning rule, which
may point to facilitation, or simply a higher mortality rate before the
trees reached 7 cm diameter. On the other hand, models such as xComp,
PICUS and TreeMig are above the self-thinning line (Reineke), indicating
that they have higher mortality in recruitment of mixed species forest
than the expected in an even-aged single species forests, which
indicates strong compensation for the initial overestimation of
recruitment in some models. However, some of the models simulate a
mortality rate in recruitment that is broadly compatible with the
self-thinning rule, i.e. 4C, SIBYLA , LandClim and LANDIS II.

Models with higher mortality also show higher tree recruitment at 7cm
(Figure \@ref(fig:)\@ref(fig:mortality13)). On the other hand, most of
the models with a low variation in mortality between 7 and 10 cm
(ForCEEPS, ForCLim 1, ForClim 11 and LandClim) also have lower
overestimation in recruitment at 7 cm (Figure \@ref(fig:mortality11) and
FigureS XX). Some of the models that start at a lower number of
individuals (7cm thershold) have a lower decrease between 7 and 10cm dbh
(ratio 7-10cm); in these models the species competition and
self-thinning is either not that large or it happened before the species
reached 7cm. However, this pattern it is not consistent across models
(FigureS XX). There is an effect of the number of individuals at 7cm on
the mortality rate. Most of the models show a positive effect
(increasing recruitment at 7cm shows increases the mortality between 7
and 10cm), but some models show a negative effect, however the trend it
is not very high and not always significant when we look at the slope of
the linear trends per model (FigureS XX and tableS XX).

-   Implications of models that have lower mortality

-   The problem of correctly capturing post-disturbance recovery, how
    seed availability and climate conditions define the 15-20 years
    status of a forest. If this is not well capture by the models we can
    not really assess the impacts of disturbances on forests.

-   Range shifts retractions in species expansions because of climate
    change might not also be properly represented if we do not capture
    properly recruitment rates in the environmental gradient .

-   If the composition is not well captured then we can not assess the
    functional composition of the forest appropriately, e.g. their
    sensitive to drought or resilience to new disturbances events.

-   Species richness variations might be explained by the way each model
    considers the recruitment (e.g. in the absence of adults recruitment
    can be linked to either seed rain form elsewhere -dispersal, or to
    sees/seedling bank) Differences might also be expected between
    cohort and individual trees based models.

-   Why models with feedback also underestimate species richness in
    recruitment?

-   Is the adult forest the right forest, how is this relevant and is
    this the consequence for the correct recruitment composition? This
    is highly dependent on the model structure:

    -   Background seed Yes/no

    -   Stochastic vs deterministic

-   We do not know what happen before 7cm in the observed data and does
    not make sense to look at that in the simulated data. 7cm is a large
    sapling, consequences of not having that information to asses forest
    dynamics. Recommendations on data collection.

-   Methodological aspects: difference in observations number between
    observed data (2-4 samples per site) and the simulated data (200
    samples per site) and the implication on variability. Assumption
    equilibrium it is expected overestimation because we do not know the
    status of the observed data more certainly not in equilibrium etc

-   Observed data has much more sites without any recruitment (zero
    inflated data). Many models seem to predict recruitment in all
    sites. The zeros in the emprical data come from no recruitment and
    from tresholds larger than 10cm for some sites. Is this a
    consequence of assuming that the observed data is also in
    equilibrium. Lack of recruitment in sites an indication of
    "non-equilibrium" due to management history?

-   Why the models over predicting species richness at the stand level
    are all the "ForClim family" and FORMIND ?

-   Also BTW, the reason why some models have zero regeneration at very
    low BA values may be that they never actually simulate such low BA
    values at the one ha level (which was the sampling unit if I recall
    correctly). If so, this should be pointed out as well, I think.

-   \# H1: the higher regen7 the stronger the regen mortality

    \# decrease in stem number between regen7 and regen10

    \# as ratio nn7/nn10 (colname nn710)

    \# reference lines

    \# -ratio 1 = no decrease from 7 -\> 10

    \# -ratio for selfthinning under even aged conditions

    \# with Reineke exp rk=-1.605: (7/10)\^(-1.605) = 1.77

-   Models below the Reineke line have lower mortality than expected by
    the self-thinning
    rule, which may point to facilitation, or simply a higher mortality
    rate before the trees reached 7 cm diameter. But then these models
    would need to underestimate recruitment levels (Fig. 1), no? But
    this is not what we see... not sure how to explain.

-   methodological limitations compare mortality with the self thinning
    line etc Values below the 1.0 line show sites where there is a
    higher number of 10 cm trees than in 7 cm - this is an
    artifact of the method - we expect space for time substitution, but
    in reality
    we just have one measurement (Figure 7).

-   There might be a difference between models including stochastic
    processes in recruitment and those which do not, but perhaps the
    reality implies higher mortality rates in the adult component
    (enhance the share of less shade tolerant species?) [to the
    discussion] ((Figure \@ref(fig:mortality11) and
    \@ref(fig:mortality13)).

-    Most models maintain or even increase in recruitment diversity
    between the 7 and 10 cm thresholds, and the same is visible from the
    observed data, however the differences are not significant.
    **EXPLAIN WHY  "Can we understand this (I know this is for the
    Discussion, but still...)?? This cannot be species richness (as
    there are no new species popping between 7 and 10 cm DBH). I'd also
    expect the number of species to be lower at 10 cm than at 7 cm
    (because some will die off due to insufficient light etc.), but this
    is not reflected in H' because species with zero abundance are
    ignored (ln[0] is not defined). So a strongly increasing evenness
    must be driving this increase of H'."** This could be because we are
    comparing 7 and 10cm from same samples, and at 10cm you might
    include more trees and at 7cm This calls for further research and
    anotehr paper :D

-    Generally, the approach was appreciated a lot, i.e. the idea of
    confronting the simulated recruitment along environmental gradients
    with data from such gradients. With EuFoRIa, we seem to be on a very
    good track in this regard.\
    \
    • Critical comments were given to the choice of an ingrowth limit of
    10 cm DBH. Many participants said, in one way or the other, that the
    good match is not surprising because if the model gets overall
    species composition right, it must also get ingrowth of these rather
    large trees right. Thus, a better test would be for the ingrowth
    limit to be lower. My explanation that we wanted to maximize the
    dataset available and thus chose the highest callipering limit was
    accepted, but I think it is definitely so that we need to provide
    data with a lower limit. How much data do we lose if we go down to 4
    cm? I am afraid that going down to 1 cm is not realistic because
    we\'d lose most of the data. So the bottomline is that 10 cm are
    fine, but a very soft test, and hence we need to provide material
    for a harder test. Can you tell me (1) how much data we\'d lose with
    4 cm, and (2) what the patterns along the two gradients (CWB and DD)
    are looking like when using a 4 cm threshold?\
    \
    • Many participants also felt that we should not miss out on a third
    very important axis, i.e. light availability. Obviously this is more
    tricky because we do not have such measurements, but I think we can
    work with proxies such as basal area (although it\'s difficult for
    the small sampling plots, as light availability may be poorly
    related to BA on a 500 m2 plot...). Have you looked into this
    already? It would be really nice if we could provide a pattern that
    shows how recruitment of the different species is becoming sparser
    and drops out completely as a function of a proxy of light
    availability.\
    \
    Beyond that, some people expressed their desire to calibrate a
    recruitment model based on the EuFoRIa data, and I tried to explain
    why I think it is more insightful to use these data for model
    benchmarking: we can learn more... :-)\
