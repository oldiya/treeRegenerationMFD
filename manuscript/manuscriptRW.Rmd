# Abstract

Tree establishment is a key process in forest dynamics, particularly in
the context of forest resilience after disturbance and climate change.
Models of forest dynamics have been in use since more than 50 years, but
an assessment of their capacity to represent tree establishment is
lacking. We assess how well current models are capturing the overall
abundance, species composition and mortality of tree establishment.

Using 15 models and model variants buil to capture longterm (i.e.,
decadal to centennial) forest dynamics at the stand, landscape and
global levels, we simulate tree establishment at 200 sites representing
environmental gradients across Europe. The results are benchmarked
against comprehensive data from forest reserves.

Most of the models overestimate ingrowth rates, but this is not always
compensated by high simulated mortality rates in the early stages of
population dynamics. In the models, the effect of light availability on
ingrowth rates is captured better than the effect of temperature and
soil moisture, but the patterns are not consistent across models.
Simulated species diversity matches the observed ranges quite well.
Models simulating higher species diversity at the stand level do not
feature higher ingrowth diversity. The ingrowth of *Abies alba* is
captured across temperature and soil moisture gradients, whereas *Fagus
sylvatica* is generally underestimated. *Picea abies* ingrowth is
generally overestimated, particularly at colder sites. Increasing
complexity in the tree establishment modules of the models is not
related to higher accuracy of simulated tree establishment. Furthermore,
individual model design is more important than scale (stand, landscape,
global) and approach (empirical, process-based) to accurately capture
tree establishment.

Even though the overestimation of tree establishment represent a
challenge for the usefulness of model~~s~~ projections under uncertain
conditions such a climate change, and although some formulations should
be reconsidered to correct excessive ingrowth levels, it is remarkable
that most of the~~se~~ models capture the essential features of the
highly complex process of tree establishment, while not having been
parameterized with such a data. We conclude that in spite of all the
uncertainties, many models hold promise for assessing longterm forest
dynamics under changing environmental conditions.

# Introduction

Forests provide a wide range of products and services of vital
importance to humankind. Under the pressure of climate change and
increasing disturbances, it is becoming ever more important to
understand how forest structure, composition and function will change,
and to evaluate forest capacity to adapt or be resilient after
disturbance [@lindner2010]. A wide range of models of forest dynamics
were developed over the past decades considering the impacts of climate
on forest dynamics [@bugmann2022]. From these studies, it is evident
that while we have a reasonably good understanding how to model tree
growth [@vanclay1997; @bugmann1996], and substantial efforts have been
dedicated to improving the depiction of tree mortality [@bugmann2019],
tree establishment remains a much less studied process that is often
represented rather coarsely in these models, which is a clear research
gap in the context of climate-induced forest disturbances and forest
resilience.

Tree establishment arises from multiple processes such as reproduction,
fruit maturation, seed production, dispersal, germination, juvenile
growth and survival [@price2001]. All these processes are difficult to
assess, and some of them are scarcely understood and thus appear highly
stochastic [@bogdziewicz2021]. Identifying the appropriate level of
complexity for the formulation of the key factors that are leading to
successful tree establishment is challenging. Currently, tree
establishment processes in dynamic forest models are handled in a
multitude of ways [@konig_tree_2022; @bugmann2022], from entirely
ignoring it [as done in classical forest growth models, e.g., Pretzsch
et al. -@pretzsch2002], across the use of a few simple environmental
filters, as done in most forest "gap" models [@shuman2011] and Dynamic
Global Vegetation Models [e.g., @hickler2012; @smith2001], to complex
approaches that incorporate local feedback from the canopy, multiple
ecological processes and often also small time steps [e.g., @seidl2012;
@wehrli2006], or field-based statistical parameterizations, which
however are not easy to extrapolate in space and time [e.g.,
@ribbens1994].

Overall, models are needed to (1) synthesize existing empirical data and
explore their consequences, and (2) assess future tree establishment
e.g., in the context of global change scenarios. Given the current
strategies that are used in models of forest dynamics to represent tree
establishment, model behavior is often facing problems that can have
strong impacts on simulated forest dynamics, such as very high levels of
tree establishment, which then necessitate excess mortality at early
stages of tree life to arrive at correct stand structure and
composition. Also, inadequately high species diversity in tree
establishment may be simulated. This is characteristic of "classical"
forest gap models [@gutiérrez2016], at least as long as the simulations
comprise a multitude of species. Other models use calibration against
local canopy-level data to define appropriate ingrowth levels, which is
likely to strongly hamper the general applicability of these models
e.g., under scenarios of climate change. Furthermore, correctly
capturing the species composition in tree establishment as a function of
the presence of seed trees in the canopy is often a particular
challenge, potentially leading to unrealistic successional drift in the
model, which must be corrected by factors that are hard to parameterize
[e.g., @lischke2006]. A related issue is the excessive reduction of
species richness due to positive feedback effects such that eventually
just single-species ~~forest~~ stands remain. This is sometimes
corrected by the incorporation of a low level of seed influx of all
species at all times [@lischke2006]. However, simulated species
composition is usually exceedingly sensitive to that level, whereas the
parameters of such functions are poorly constrained by field data.
Lastly, there is often a problem with insufficient observational
constraint on parameter values for models that start from very small
tree sizes (e.g., 10 cm of height or even seeds) and track tree
development in a process-oriented manner by considering a multitude of
ecological influences, rather than emphasizing tree establishment into a
larger size class [e.g., @wehrli2006].

Thus, a focus on the modeling of tree establishment processes is sorely
needed and overdue [@price2001] if we are to make reliable projections
of future forest dynamics, i.e., when the models need to be operated in
extrapolation mode, but also from a fundamental ecological point of view
(increasing systems understanding). Also in the field of general
ecology, tree establishment has not received a lot of attention
[@hanburybrown_forest_2022], although many sub-processes have been
studied in detail. Yet, little data is available that covers all the
processes within one species along environmental gradients, let alone
for a vast suite of species. Thus, the available data are fragmented,
which constitutes a major problem for model building. On the one hand,
monitoring on permanent sample plots (such as National Forest
Inventories) often measure tree establishment [@zell2019], however with
a design that captures the rate after the stand initiation
phase[@hallsby2015]. Data from permanent plots, although available
across regions, are highly heterogeneous, rendering their utility
difficult in a modeling context[@käber2021]. On the other hand, targeted
studies to measure tree establishment on experimental sites are often
limited in spatial extent, species studied, or the sub-set of processes
that are targeted [@berdanier2016; @collet2006].

In the present study, for the first time, a large number of forest
models commonly used to assess forest dynamics under climate change are
evaluated against a continental-scale, multi-species harmonized data set
on tree establishment [@käber2022]. By tree establishment, we refer to
the passing of trees across a specific diameter threshold ("ingrowth")
and thus as successful tree establishment. We included models that are
based on a range of "philosophies", from models operating at the stand
to the global scale as well as the range of models from empirically
derived to "process-based" [e.g., @bugmann1996; @fabrika2012;
@mette2014; @lexer2001]. Because of the large variability in tree
establishment patterns in nature and the large number of factors driving
this process --- including some that are not included in most models
such as deer browsing --- we do not aim at a detailed statistical
evaluation of each model. Instead, we aim at evaluating the general
ingrowth patterns and magnitudes simulated by the models, and benchmark
the simulated regeneration niche of multiple species against empirical
data along a wide environmental gradients of temperature, moisture, and
light availability.

More specifically, we aimed to answer the following questions. 1) Are
models of forest dynamics capturing accurately tree ingrowth levels
across environmental gradients? 2) Are they matching the initial species
composition of the tree ingrowth layer? And 3), do they correctly
represent the mortality in tree establishment?.

# Material and methods

## Models

Fifteen models of forest dynamics (including two model featuring
variants) were used to assess tree establishment. They simulate forest
dynamics at the stand, landscape and global scale (Table
\@ref(tab:tableModels)). The approaches used for model construction and
their origin differ strongly, with most of the models featuring a
largely "process-based" approach, whereas two models are based on
formulations derived from the statistical analysis of inventory data
(SYBILA and xComp). Some of the models largely rely on the original
approach underlying forest gap models (e.g., ForClim 1 and
LandClim)[,]{.underline} whereas some [a]{.underline}re based on plant
ecophysiological processes (e.g., FORMIND and iLand). The different
approaches underlying the models have strongly influenced the
formulation of tree establishment.

The establishment modules can be categorized as 'regeneration' or
'recruitment' models [@vanclay1994; @konig_tree_2022] (see Table
\@ref(tab:tableModels)). Regeneration models include processes such as
flowering and pollination, seed production, seed dispersal, germination
seedling [g]{.underline}rowth, which ultimately lead to the simulated
number of trees. Recruitment models, in contrast, introduce a certain
number of new trees with certain characteristics such as biomass or
diameter, without explicitly considering earlier development processes.
We can further distinguish models that feature a feedback in the
establishment, i.e., where the level and species composition of
establishment is influenced by the existing adult tree community via the
production of seeds, seedlings or saplings, from models that do not
contain such feedback.

The starting point for in the models differs as well, ranging from
seedbank, seed or seedling to sapling (i.e., trees much larger than 10
cm height, often at least 2-3 m tall).This implies that the larger the
size threshold, the larger the number of ecological processes that must
be aggregated via parameterizations because they cannot be treated
explicitly. This reduces model complexity but comes at the cost of
blurring process representation.

The overall complexity in the establishment modules also varies
considerably. Following @bugmann2022, we can classify seven models
(iLand, PICUS, LandClim, ForCEEPS, LPJ-GUESS, ForClim and TreeMig) as
having rather high complexity in their establishment modules (average
complexity across all processes \>0, Table \@ref(tab:tableModels)). In
most models[,]{.underline} the two processes in the establishment
modules with the highest complexity are the statistical approach used to
define the successful number of new treesand how frost occurrence is
taken into account.

Two models, ForClim and ForCEEPs, were used here with two alternative
variants. ForClim variant 1 [@bugmann1996] is based on a recruitment
module that adheres closely to the concept introduced by @botkin1972,
whereas ForClim variant 11 is adopting a rather different approach that
considers space filling along with different 'points of entry' for the
action of specific environmental factors [@huber2020]. These two model
variants allow us to evaluate a more process-based module (variant 11)
against a simple module (variant 1), while the rest of the model
structure is identical. Similarly, the two ForCEEPS variants allow us to
isolate the importance of the canopy feedback via seed trees for the
quantity and quality of simulated ingrowth[,]{.underline} as one variant
includes this feedback whereas the other does not.

## Observed data

Ingrowth data covering a wide range of environmental conditions are hard
to obtain, and this is one of the reasons why most models of forest
dynamics have never been confronted with a dataset covering such
gradients over a large number sites, to evaluate how well ingrowth is
captured. The observations used here are from a novel and unprecedented
network of sites in forest reserves that represent the range of
environmental gradients in temperature and precipitation in central
Europe as compiled in the framework of the EuFoRIa network[@euforia2019]
(Figure \@ref(fig:map)). All these forests have not been managed for at
least 10 years prior to their designation as reserves, and most of them
provide time series of natural forest dynamics over multiple decades and
up to ca. 80 years. The census periods range from 3 to 37 years, with an
average of 14 years. The data provide information at the tree level,
thus allowing for sequential comparison such as individual-tree ingrowth
and death between the measurements.

We selected 200 sites from this network as the benchmarking data set for
the simulation. The selection of sites is representative for the
environmental variation of the data. This was achieved by applying
kmeans clustering to define 200 clusters of plots from the original set
of 869 plots along the environmental dimensions of temperature, water
balance, soil quality and exposition (i.e., slope and aspect). Each of
these sites featured at least two consecutive measurements. Ingrowth was
measured at threshold of 7 or 10 cm of stem diameter at all sites except
for 35 sites where only ingrowth at the 10 cm diameter threshold was
available. Plot size ranged from 0.02 ha to 5.52 ha, and the data were
further processed and aggregated following @käber2022 to provide
ingrowth rates per ha and per decade. The observations used in this
study featured 30.900 established trees, and ingrowth rates per site,
sample and decade ranged from zero to 1246 trees per ha, with a mean of
56 trees per ha. For more details on this unique dataset and the
detailed establishment information, cf. @käber2022.

## Simulation protocol

The overarching goal of the experiments was to assess the regeneration
niche as it arises from empirical data against its representation in a
wide range of models of forest dynamics. We define the regeneration
niche as the passing of a diameter threshold of 7 or 10
cm[,]{.underline} respectively (synonym: ingrowth). To this end, each
modeling group was provided with a detailed protocol (cf. Supplementary
Material 1, henceforth "SM") with instructions how to perform the
simulations, providing input variables on climate and soil conditions,
and the expected output variables. Neither were further site information
(except for the data specified below) nor any data on tree ingrowth
provided prior to the simulation. That is, the models were run in "blind
flight" mode.

The input variables were collected and aggregated to be adapted to the
needs of the different models. Time series of climatic variables from
1981 to 2018 were provided in hourly [Era5-land data, Muñoz Sabater
-@muñozsabater2019], daily and monthly resolution [CHELSA data, Karger
et al. -@karger2021]. Some variables required for some models such as
relative humidity or vapor pressure deficit had to be calculated from
these variables. The final strategy how to use the climate data was
different in each model, based on the approach that best suited the
model (Table \@ref(tab:tableModels)). Soil quality data was provided as
a continuous value between 1 and 5 [Soilgrids dataset, Hengl et al.
-@hengl2017, Poggio et al. -@poggio2021]. The protocol also provided the
elevation, slope and aspect for each of the 200 sites
[@asterscienceteam2019], but no other spatial information such as
coordinates was provided, with the exception of iLand[,]{.underline}
which used the blurred coordinates to derive highly detailed soil data.

The simulations were run in the absence of natural disturbances. Only
the model LPJ-GUESS had to include HERE LPJ-GUESS PROVIDE [ONE
SENTENCE]{.underline} OF WHY YOU INCLUDED DISTURBANCES AND WHAT TYPE.
The simulations were set up to sample species-specific ingrowth rates
per decade and per ha in the equilibrium state of the model, typically
entailing a "spin-up" run (as we did not provide any forest data). The
modeling teams decided on the simulated area and how they derived these
samples. The exact length of the simulation was also decided by the
modeling teams (Table \@ref(tab:tableModels)). Further details on how
each modeling team prepared the simulations and the outputs are
available in SM 2.

The simulations were run in the absence of management to a
simulated equilibrium ("Potential Natural Vegetation") with the current
climate, as the ultimate goal was to derive the regeneration niche. This
entails the assumption that (1) the observations from the forest
reserves reflect no traces of forest management and (2) there is an
equilibrium between forest dynamics and climate. While the former is
likely to be met at least in many of the EuFoRIA reserves, the latter
may be more debatable. However, in the absence of detailed data on the
history of each plot in the EuFoRIa network, some broad assumptions had
to be made. Both the width of the regeneration niche (i.e., in
environmental space) as well as the intensity of the ingrowth process
(i.e., the number of ingrowth trees per area and per unit of time) were
of interest.

The simulations were run for mixed species forests (not multiple
single-species simulations) using mixtures of eleven species or genera
for which ingrowth data of sufficient quality were available from
EuFoRIa: *Fagus sylvatica, Picea abies, Abies alba, Carpinus betulus,
Tilia cordata, Acer pseudoplatanus, Betula spp., Fraxinus excelsior,
Quercus spp., Alnus glutinosa, Pinus sylvestris.* Two models included
their standard set of species for the simulations which is much larger
(i.e., ForClim 1, ForClim 11). This also applies to TreeMig, but in this
model *Betula pendula* was not included because HERE **TREEMIG**
PROVIDES THE END OF THIS SENTENCE SAYING WHY B pendula WAS NOT INCLUDED.
In three models, fewer than these elveven species were simulated (4C,
xComp, LPJ-GUESS) (Table \@ref(tab:tableModels)). HERE **4C** PROVIDES
[ONE SENTENCE]{.underline} WHY THEY SIMULATED LESS SPECIES. HERE
**XCOMP** PROVIDES [ONE SENTENCE]{.underline} WHY THEY SIMULATED LESS
SPECIES. HERE **LPJ-GUESS** PROVIDES [ONE SENTENCE]{.underline} WHY THEY
SIMULATED LESS SPECIES. Finally, the model aDGVM2 is based on a suite of
broad Plant Functional Types rather than individual species, and hence
this model used its default approach of PFTs for the simulations.

Each of the models reported the ingrowth number by sampling 200 times
over a 10-year interval for each species and per ha for each of the 200
sites. Multiple samples per site were used to better understand the
simulated variation within each site. This was done using different
strategies, depending on the model, including (1) sampling simulated
data from the same 1-ha plot in the equilibrium over time, or (2)
sampling several 1-ha plots from the simulated forest at one specific
point in time (in the equilibrium). This resulted in 880.000
observations per model that simulated the 11 species included in the
protocol (200 sites, 200 samples per site, 11 species and two diameter
thresholds). For the models that simulated additional species, their
ingrowth rates were aggregated as "others".

Three models did not provide results from all the simulated samples or
sites to avoid unrealistic results, as follows. In the model 4C, a
threshold of a maximum basal area of 100 $m^2 ha^{-1}$ was used to avoid
unrealistic stand basal area data, and therefore not all the samples and
sites were reported. The reason for this is that 4C is not suitable for
long-term simulations without management PLEASE **4C** VERIFY THIS IS
WHAT YOU DID. LPJ-GUESS had 2% of the sample outputs as grasslands that
were considered in the data as zero stand basal area and zero ingrowth
for all the tree species simulated. LPJ-GUESS could not simulate one of
the sites HERE **LPJ-GUESS** PROVIDES [ONE SENTENCE]{.underline} WHY
THEY DID NOT PROVIDE ALL THE SITES. Landis-II missed 0.2% of the
observations HERE **LANDIS-II** PROVIDES [ONE SENTENCE]{.underline} WHY
THEY DID NOT PROVIDE ALL THE SAMPLES/observations.

```

## Data analysis

The simulation results were analyzed regarding the ingrowth levels
(i.e., ingrowth number per unit time and space), species composition of
the ingrowth, and ingrowth mortality. The observed data were modeled
using a Generalized Additive Model with a negative binomial distribution
to better understand the trend and levels of the observed ingrowth,
relative to the simulation results per model.

Ingrowth levels were evaluated along three key environmental gradients,
i.e., stand basal area (the basal area of all the trees in each sample)
as a proxy of light availability at the forest floor, the annual
degree-day sum (DD) [@allen1976; @fischlin1995] as a proxy for growing
season warmth, and the climatic water balance (CWB) as a proxy for soil
moisture [@speich2019]. The mean ingrowth values were calculated as the
mean across the 200 samples per site.

We evaluated the species composition across models and in relation to
the observed data by calculating the Shannon index based on the relative
frequency of the species in terms of basal area. The higher the value of
the index, the higher the species diversity at a particular site and
sample (Equation \ref{eqpiShannon}).

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
H_n = - \sum_{i = 1}^{s}{p_{i}ln(p_{n,i})}\label{eqpiShannon}
\end{equation}
```
```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
p_{n,i} = \frac{r_{BA_{n,i}}}{Total_{BA_{n}}} \label{eqpiShannon2}
\end{equation}
```
where $s$ is the total number of species simulated that have ingrowth
basal area above zero in sample $n$; $p_{n,i}$ is the proportion of the
species $i$ calculated as the ingrowth basal area ($r_{BA_{n,i}}$) for
that species $i$ relative to the stand basal area ($Total_{BA_{n}}$) of
the sample $n$.

In order to analyze the relationship between the adult species
composition and ingrowth across the climatic gradients, we focused on
the five main tree species or genera: *Abies alba*, *Fagus sylvatica*,
*Picea abies*, *Pinus sylvestris*, and *Quercus* spp. For these species,
we calculated the mean ingrowth basal area share per site as the mean
value across the available samples per site:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\bar{R}_{BA_{share_{t,i}}} = \frac{\bar{r}_{t,i}}{\sum_{i = 1}^{s}{\bar{r}_{t,i}}} \label{eq:BAshare}
\end{equation}
```
where $s$ is the total number of species simulated; $\bar{r}_{t,i}$ is
the mean ingrowth of the species $i$ per site $t$ across the available
samples at that site.

The data from 35 sites that had a diameter threshold of 10 cm only, and
therefore ingrowth rates for these sites at 7 cm are not known. The 35
sites were removed from the simulated data to make a fair comparison
regarding the ingrowth of the five main species. Furthermore, regarding
the ingrowth basal area share per species ($\bar{R}_{BA_{share_{i}}}$),
we categorized this as zero when the total ingrowth basal area (
$\sum_{i = 1}^{s}{\bar{r}_{t,i}}$ ) equaled zero, and also when the
ingrowth basal area of that species ($\bar{r}_{t,i}$) was zero.

Mortality in tree establishment was assessed based on the ratio of
ingrowth between the 7 and 10 cm diameter thresholds. We used the
Reineke self-thinning rule [@reineke1933; @pretzsch2003] as a reference
to estimate whether the different ingrowth values were above or below
the expected theoretical rate between these two diameters. The Reineke
self-thinning rule is usually calculated from even-aged, single species
stands and assumes a relationship between the number of stems and the
quadratic mean diameter in fully stocked pure stands. The value used in
our comparisons was 1.77, calculated using Equation \ref{eqReineke}.

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
Reineke = (7/10)^{(-1.605)} \label{eqReineke}
\end{equation}
```
# Results

## Ingrowth levels

The ingrowth levels varied strongly across the 15 models and typically
did not match the levels found in the forest reserve data (Figure
\@ref(fig:over)). Ingrowth was overestimated in most models for both the
7 and 10 cm diameter thresholds, with the exception of the empirical
stand model SYBILA, the landscape model Landis-II and the global model
aDGVM2, which estimated ingrowth rates at the lower end of the
plausibility interval of the observed data (Figure \@ref(fig:over)). The
models with the largest overestimation were the stand model PICUS and
the landscape model TreeMig. For most models, the variability of
simulated ingrowth levels across the 200 sites (visible from the
interquartile range in the box plots of Figure \@ref(fig:over)) was
similar to or smaller than observed, with the notable exception of
PICUS, where simulated ingrowth variability was much larger than that of
any other model.

```{r over, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Mean ingrowth rates across all samples per site, plotted for the 200 sites and for each model. The red dotted lines shows the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles for the 7 cm diameter threshold in the observed data.", out.width='100%'}
        knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures", "recOverAll710.png"))
```

When evaluating the representation of ingrowth rates along key gradients
of light availability (basal area), temperature (degree-days) and soil
moisture (climatic water balance), distinct features emerge: the models
reproduced the effect of basal area (Figure \@ref(fig:nvTrend710BA))
much better than the effects of the climatic gradients, where they
featured varying effects (Figures S1 and S2).

In the observed data, ingrowth rates decreased clearly with increasing
stand basal area (Figure \@ref(fig:nvTrend710BA)). This trend was
captured by the Landis-II model only, albeit at much lower values of
basal area than in the observations. The other models featured
distinctly different trends, such as (1) an increase in ingrowth with
increasing total basal area followed by the absence of ingrowth at high
values of basal area (ForCEEPS, ForCEEPS(f), FORMIND, TreeMig and
LPJ-GUESS), (2) almost constant ingrowth levels with basal area (ForClim
11, xComp, LandClim and aDGVM2), or (3) an increase of ingrowth up to a
certain value of stand basal area followed by a decrease at even higher
values of stand basal area, with model-specific thresholds (4C, ForClim
1, PICUS, SYBILA and iLand).

The models did not match the observed ingrowth patterns across gradients
of soil moisture and temperature (Figures S1 and S2), and neither was
there a clear pattern across models. Regarding the soil moisture
gradient (Figure S1), a group of models featured decreasing ingrowth
with increasing soil moisture (4C, ForClim 1, ForClim11, SIBYLA, xComp,
PICUS and LandClim), while a few models showed the opposite trend
(ForCEEPs(f), FORMIND and LPJ-GUESS). Across the temperature gradient
(Figure S2), all the models that featured a decrease in ingrowth rates
with increasing soil moisture showed the opposite trend (i.e., more
ingrowth with increasing temperature), except for 4C. The other models
did not feature a clear pattern.

Both observations and simulated data had no ingrowth in some samples and
at some sites (Table S1). The observed data had slightly more than 3% of
the samples with no ingrowth. Only three models had a larger proportion
of no ingrowth (4C, Landis-II and aDVM2). Three models always simulated
ingrowth for both the 7 and 10 cm threshold (TreeMig and LPJ-GUESS),
i.e., they did not feature any zero values. The other models had a very
low percentage of samples with no ingrowth (0.01% - 1.31%), i.e., they
had distinctly fewer occurrences of zeros compared to the observations.
There was no significant relationship between the mean complexity of the
establishment module (Table \@ref(tab:tableModels)) and the
overestimation proportion at a diameter threshold of 7 cm (Table S2).

```

## Species composition of ingrowth

Most models matched the level of diversity of the observed data quite
well (Figure \@ref(fig:H710)), although they consistently underestimated
its variability across sites. Four models overestimated ingrowth
diversity: 4C, PICUS, Landis-II and LPJ-GUESS, the latter mostly for the
10 cm diameter threshold. The model 4C is a special case as it simulated
five species only, i.e., its diversity values are not directly
comparable to those of the other models, nor to the observations. Only
one model, SIBYLA, consistently underestimated ingrowth diversity.

In most models, there were only small but significant differences in the
species diversity of ingrowth between 7 and 10 cm across sites (Tables
S2-S4). Furthermore, three models (4C, SIBYLA, Landis-II) maintained the
ingrowth diversity between the 7 and 10 cm thresholds (i.e., the
differences between them were not significant, see Table S3), and the
same was evident from the observed data. There were a few models with a
strong increase of ingrowth diversity between 7 and 10 cm (ForCEEPS,
TreeMig, LPJ-GUESS, Figure \@ref(fig:H710)).

```{r H710, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Shannon index of tree ingrowth, calculated by basal area, as the mean value across the 200 samples per site for the diameter thresholds of 7 and 10 cm, respectively. The red dotted lines represent the 20th percentile of the observed data for the threshold of 7 cm and the 70th percentile of the observed data for the threshold of 10 cm.", out.width='100%'}
    knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures", "H7_10.png"))
```

For both the observed and the simulated data, and both ingrowth
thresholds, species diversity was lower in the ingrowth compared to
stand-level diversity (Figures S3 and S4). Yet, models simulating higher
diversity at the stand level featured higher diversity in ingrowth
(Figure S3 and S4). Most models captured reasonably well or
overpredicted species diversity at the stand level (Figure
\@ref(fig:combinedRichness)A, center; cf. Figure S5)[,]{.underline} but
a characteristic feature was that simulations had a much lower
variability of diversity compared to observations. Models overpredicting
species richness included ForClim1, ForClim 11, FORMIND and TreeMig
(Figure \@ref(fig:combinedRichness)A, left). Several models
underpredicted species diversity, i.e., LPJ-GUESS, ForCEEPS(f) and 4C
(Figure \@ref(fig:combinedRichness)A, right). The majority of the models
captured reasonably well the ingrowth diversity at lower values of
diversity, but most of them strongly underestimated ingrowth diversity
for higher observed diversity levels (Figure
\@ref(fig:combinedRichness)B, cf. Figure S6). Both the models with
feedback and those without feedback from the adult trees to ingrowth
(via seed production) underestimated ingrowth species diversity compared
to the observations. Again, simulated diversity was considerably less
variable than observed diversity (Fig. \@ref(fig:combinedRichness)B).

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures", "combined_richness.png"))
```

Silver fir (*Abies alba*), beech (*Fagus sylvatica*), Scots pine (*Pinus
sylvestris*) and oak (*Quercus* spp.) were the species observed most
frequently in the EuFoRIa data. Most models captured well the share of
basal area in the ingrowth of these five species compared to the
observed data along the two major gradients of climate (Figure
\@ref(fig:diff), cf. Figure S7). However, the models differed
considerably in the way in which they simulated their climatic niche.

First, some models overestimated ingrowth across the entire gradients
for at least one of the five main tree species (Figure \@ref(fig:diff),
e.g., ForCEEPS, ForCEEPS(f), LandClim or LPJ-GUESS), while other models
overestimated ingrowth for more than one species for a large part of the
climate gradients, such as xComp, PICUS, SYBILA or LPJ-GUESS (cf. red
colors in Figure \@ref(fig:diff)). These trends were consistent for both
ingrowth thresholds, although the exact changes in the share of the
ingrowth basal area were somewhat different (Figure S7).

Second, there was some congruence in the simulation results by species
across the models. The share in the ingrowth by Silver fir (*Abies
alba*) was captured well across the gradient by most models except for
xComp, PICUS, LandClim and Landis-II, which overestimated the ingrowth
share of this species. There were also some peculiarities evident for
some models, such as 4C that did not simulate *Abies alba*. *Fagus
sylvatica* ingrowth was underestimated by many models across the
environmental gradients, including ForCEEPS(f) and FORMIND, which
featured negligible ingrowth at most sites for this species. Most of the
models overestimated the share of *Picea abies* ingrowth in the cold-wet
part of the gradients. *Pinus sylvestris* and *Quercus* spp. represented
a smaller share of the ingrowth in the observed data mostly at warm-dry
sites. Many models, however, erroneously featured ingrowth for these two
species along most of the climatic gradients although at a low basal
area share. Five models (4C, FORMIND, SYBILA, xComp, and LandClim) had
almost no ingrowth of *Pinus sylvestris* and *Quercus* spp., or did not
feature any ingrowth of of these species at all.

Lastly, there is no model that performed well across the five species
regarding the species-specific ingrowth rates in the environmental space
of Figure 6. Some models (e.g., ForClim11, PICUS) tended to consistently
overestimate the ingrowth share of all five species, but most models
overestimated the ingrowth share of some species while underestimating
the share of others (e.g., ForCEEPS, LPJ-GUESS).

```{r diff, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Ingrowth rates of the five main species in terms of their basal area share in the observations (top row) and the performance of each model across the environmental gradients (other rows) for the 7 cm ingrowth threshold.

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures", "HeatEnvGrad_10circles_7.png"))
```

## Ingrowth mortality

There were strong differences among the models regarding the mortality
rate between 7 and 10 cm (Figure \@ref(fig:mortality11)). Most of the
models featured a mortality rate significantly larger than the observed
data, thus at least partially compensating for the general
overestimation of ingrowth rates (Figure \@ref(fig:over) and Table S5);
six models did not feature a significant difference compared to the
observed data (ForCEEPS, FORMIND, ForClim 1 and 11, and aDGVM2), and
only the model LPJ-GUESS had a significantly lower mortality rate. Four
models (xComp, PICUS, LandClim and TreeMig) featured very high mortality
rates (i.e., well above the Reineke self-thinning line), which
compensated for the strong initial overestimation of ingrowth (cf.
Figure 2). Interestingly, two models that underestimated overall
ingrowth levels (SIBYLA and Landis-II; cf. Figure \@ref(fig:over))
featured mortality rates that were close to but still above the
self-thinning line (Figure \@ref(fig:mortality11)).

The fact that some models featured lower mortality than expected by
Reineke's self-thinning rule may point to facilitation, or simply a
higher mortality rate before the trees had reached 7 cm diameter. Yet,
the case of models such as xComp, PICUS and TreeMig, whose mortality was
well above the self-thinning line, indicates that they feature higher
ingrowth mortality in mixed-species forests compared to even-aged,
single-species forests. Some models yielded a mortality rate of ingrowth
that is broadly compatible with the self-thinning rule (i.e., 4C and
LandClim).

The three models with the largest overestimation of the proportion of
ingrowth at the 7 cm threshold featured the highest mortality between
the 7 and 10 cm thresholds (Figure \@ref(fig:mortality13)A). The other
models that overestimated ingrowth had mortalities lower than the
expected self-thinning ratio (Figure \@ref(fig:mortality13)B). It is
noteworthy that most of the models that featured a low ratio of ingrowth
between 7 and 10 cm (i.e., ForCEEPS, ForClim 1, ForClim 11 and
LandClim) (Figure S8) had only a small overestimation of ingrowth at the
7 cm threshold (Figure \@ref(fig:mortality11) cf. Figure S8). aDGVM2 was
the only model that underestimated ingrowth at the 7 cm threshold while
featuring a low mortality between the two thresholds (Figure
\@ref(fig:mortality13)C), and only a few models were close to the
correct ingrowth rate at 7 cm while also being close to the Reineke line
(SIBYLA, Landis-II; cf. Figure \@ref(fig:mortality13)D; and 4C as well
as LandClim).

Lastly, some models that started at a low number of individuals (7 cm
threshold) had a lower decrease of ingrowth between 7 and 10 cm dbh
(ratio 7-10 cm) (Figure S10). In these models, competition and
self-thinning are either not pronounced or must have occurred before the
species had reached 7 cm. However, this pattern was not consistent
across models (Figure S9). It is noteworthy that there is a relationship
between the ingrowth rate at 7 cm and the mortality rate: most of the
models showed a positive effect (higher ingrowth at 7 cm is coupled to
an increase of the mortality between 7 and 10 cm). While some models
showed a negative effect, this linear trend was not pronounced and not
always significant regarding the slope (Figure S9 and Table S2).

# Discussion

Tree establishment is a fundamental process in forest dynamics, in
particular with increasing disturbance under climate change. Correctly
capturing tree ingrowth in dynamic models is fundamental to, for
example, evaluate post-disturbance dynamics as it will define forest
state in the first decades [@seidl2022]. If this initial phase is not
captured well, we can not properly assess aspects such as forest
resilience or the timing, magnitude and progression of carbon
sequestration. In this study, for the first time, projections of tree
establishment from multiple models of forest dynamics were confronted
with a unique dataset from unmanaged forest reserves across a large
environmental gradient in Europe.

The observed data that we used [@käber2022] are also exceptional,
particularly with respect to the number of events captured, which is
essential for a highly 'noisy' process such as tree establishment. The
use of this dataset for model benchmarking provided novel insights on
the capability of state-of-the art models to simulate ingrowth levels,
species composition, and mortality in an early stage of tree life, i.e.,
between a tree diameter of 7 and 10 cm. Overall, by adopting this
approach a much broader understanding resulted than if we had used these
data for model calibration: it is primarily from the failure of the
models that we can gain ecological insights [e.g., @trugman2022].

## Ingrowth levels

Most of the models tended to overestimate tree ingrowth rates. This has
potentially far-reaching implications, e.g., regarding biomass (and thus
carbon) turnover, with a potential overestimation of the capacity for
forest carbon sequestration [@pugh2019; @pan2011]. Yet, we focused on
one specific stage, i.e., ingrowth into the 7 and 10 cm diameter
classes. Trees at this size contribute little to carbon sequestration,
and if the excess ingrowth rate at this stage is compensated -- in the
models -- soon thereafter by higher mortality, overall simulated
ingrowth may still yield trustworthy results at the level of stand
structure and related forest attributes such as basal area or biomass.

From a modeling point of view, excess ingrowth inevitable requires
excess mortality rates in a later stage, either -- as observed for some
models -- between the 7 and 10 cm diameter thresholds, before the 7 cm
are reached, or soon after the 10 cm threshold has been crossed. In any
case, correcting at early stages for the expected forest densities at
later stages is equivalent to compensating for a first error (excess
ingrowth) by a second error (excess mortality). Thus, many models appear
to get the 'right answer', i.e., correct stand structure and
composition, for the wrong reasons. It is highly likely that biased
projections will result, because the two errors are unlikely to be
perfectly linked and thus will not always compensate each other. Hence,
this structural problem of most models investigated here is problematic
particularly if the models are to be used under novel conditions such as
under climate change [e.g., @huber2021] or in a decision support context
[e.g., @thrippleton2021].

In spite of this criticism, it is remarkable that most models were not
overly off with respect to simulated ingrowth levels -- after all, few
if any of the models' establishment routines are sufficiently
constrained by data, with the exception of the empirical models xComp
and SIBYLA. It is noteworthy that in spite of their empirical basis,
both models were off relative to empirical ingrowth levels, in similar
magnitude as the other models and even in opposite directions (SIBYLA:
underestimation; xComp: overestimation). It appears that using empirical
data of limited geographical scope, as done in either of these models,
leads to extrapolation problems already under current climatic
conditions. For the other models, whose establishment module is not
strongly constrained by empirical data, the degrees of freedom that are
available for modeling ingrowth [@konig_tree_2022] could have implied
that model performance would be much worse.

Ingrowth levels define the structure and composition of future forests,
but it is equally important to correctly identify areas where ingrowth
is lacking [@rammer2021]. There are multiple constraints to the
regeneration niche of tree species [@price2001], and therefore the
absence of ingrowth is likely to be common [@fortin2007], even over
larger areas such as the one-hectare plots used here. Tree ingrowth data
are characterized by zero-inflation. This was clearly evident from the
EuFoRIa dataset, but some of the models did not produce zeros at all, or
featured a very low proportion of zero data. This substantial difference
may be due to the fact that the simulation results were drawn from
equilibrium forests, whereas in reality many of the forest reserves are
recovering from past management activities and have become denser and
darker over the past decades [e.g., @heiri2009], leading to less
ingrowth than in an equilibrium situation.

Competition for light as a strong filter for tree establishment has been
documented widely [@messier1999; @collet2006; @berdanier2016]. However,
it is difficult to measure light availability at large spatial and
temporal scales. We used total stand basal area as a proxy for light
availability [cf. @schmid2021]. We found pronounced differences in the
stand basal area ranges simulated by the models, but also between the
models and the observations. This made it impossible to evaluate the
establishment for the extremes of the density ranges in some models. For
example, ingrowth rates at low stand densities are relevant to assess
how well forests are recovering e.g., after gap creation due to
disturbance [@seidl2022; @grubb1977]. At the level of the simulated
one-hectare samples, average basal area is typically not very low as
long as no larger disturbances occur, which was explicitly excluded in
our simulation protocol. Towards the other end of the spectrum, i.e.,
with increasing basal area, it would be reasonable to expect that with
increasing stand basal area, the ingrowth of the different species would
become sparser and drop out entirely under low-light conditions
[@klopcic2012; @zell2019]. However, few models showed this trend, thus
indicating that the relation between ingrowth and light availability is
not yet captured correctly in most models.

## Species composition of ingrowth

Correctly capturing species composition in tree establishment is
important to assess the future functional diversity of a forest, e.g.,
its sensitivity to drought or resilience to disturbances [@redmond2015;
@seidl2022]. In the simulations, overall ingrowth species diversity
levels were well within the observed range for two thirds of the models
(10 out of 15). Thus, while most of the models are facing difficulties
to quantitatively match ingrowth levels (cf. above), their performance
is much better when it comes to matching the quality, i.e., the
composition of ingrowth as a function of abiotic and biotic conditions.

Yet, there were pronounced variations how the main tree species were
represented along the environmental gradients. Most models maintained or
even increased ingrowth diversity between the 7 and 10 cm thresholds,
and the same is visible from the empirical data, but the differences are
not significant. Diversity variations may be explained by the way the
individual models are considering establishment processes
[@konig_tree_2022], e.g., in the absence of adults, ingrowth can be
linked to either seed rain-dispersal, or to a seed/seedling bank. The
ingrowth rates were sampled from simulations in the equilibrium, and in
this state it is expected that non-climax species such as *Pinus
sylvestris* or *Quercus* would be of minor importance, or absent
entirely [@klopcic2015]. Most models captured this difference, which is
also found in the empirical data. Thus, although the broad patterns are
matched by many models, improvements in the quantification of the
regeneration niche of the species are needed, but this cannot be done in
the absence of robust datasets.

The species diversity of the entire stand was better captured by the
models than the diversity of tree ingrowth, and only a few models
overpredicted stand level diversity. Ingrowth composition defined as
being proportional to adult abundance, regardless of productivity, might
be a simple and cautious assumption to safely maintain relative species
abundances [@hanbury-brown2022]. However, based on the simulation
results, we did not see that models with feedback captured better the
ingrowth species diversity than those without feedback. The similar
performance between models with and without feedback might be because
the models are giving more importance to define the regeneration niche
via abiotic and biotic filters than with the habitat niche of the adult
trees [@grubb1977].

## Ingrowth mortality

There are several factors that lead to mortality in establishment such
as competition [@casper1997] in addition to multiple abiotic factors
[@schmid2021; @cunningham2006]. As mentioned above, it is reasonable to
expect that models that overestimate ingrowth of small trees will have a
particularly high mortality between the 7 and 10 cm thresholds. However,
this was not consistently evident from the simulations. This implies
that these models must have the excess of mortality in earlier or later
stages, if we assume that all models would be able to capture the
structure and composition of adult stands along the EuFoRIa gradient,
which however was not tested here.

Higher mortality towards the adult stage has important implications for
forest dynamics and the goods and services provided by forests. On the
one hand, mortality in later stages may erroneously enhance the share of
less shade tolerant species in the models [@klopcic2015], therefore
shifting the species composition. Unrealistic high stem densities for a
longer period of time may overestimate the role of tree regrowth in
carbon sink dynamics [@pugh2019]. Given our set of simulations and
analyses, we cannot conclusively assess what is going on in the models,
and further studies are required that focus on a wider range of tree
sizes and the fate of tree establishment along such a size continuum.

## Methodological considerations

The EuFoRIa data as used in this study is unique and highly suited to
better understand tree establishment. However, three aspects of this
data may also represent considerable limitations. First, we made a
comparison of tree ingrowth in a posited equilibrium state, but we
cannot assess how close the empirical data were to such a state. The
data were collected in forest reserves where no management has taken
place for long periods of time. This makes our assumption of an
equilibrium between forest properties and environmental drivers less
haphazard than it might appear at first sight. However, it may explain
why simulated ingrowth rates were higher than the observed ones. Second,
the data were collected for ingrowth above a 7 cm threshold, thus
limiting the assessment of tree establishment in a holistic sense. This
constituted a hard limit based on which we can understand some aspects
of tree establishment, which in its entirety often comprises a rather
long period since germination [@price2001]. However, many environmental
constraints are acting on young trees [@käber2021] that we were unable
to assess. Yet, ingrowth data with lower thresholds are simply not
available in a harmonized manner across large environmental gradients.
Third, the empirical data were collected from rather small plots that
ranged from 0.2 to up to 1 ha, while we sampled simulated ingrowth rates
from 1 ha areas, which may lead to an incorrect representation of space.
Even though this strategy it is not ideal, it represents a common
challenge when harmonizing diverse data sources originating from varied
sampling strategies [@portier2022]. It would have been extremely
challenging for such a variety of models to follow a protocol where the
spatial sampling size was different at each of the 200 sites.

The design of our sampling protocol did not include spatial aspects. We
considered a wide range of models of forest dynamics, from stand to
global scale. However, the simulation setup was limited to 1 ha ingrowth
values. The lack of spatial considerations potentially puts landscape
models at a disadvantage, as they have been built to be accurate~~l~~ at
the landscape level. Without spatial context, we are limiting ingrowth
to the seed influx from the stand itself, if the model does not have a
background seed input. However, Global Dynamic Vegetation Models should
not be in disadvantage due to the limited spatial considerations [but
cf. Snell et al. -@snell2014] as they are usually lacking dispersal
between cells as they are based on an abstraction of horizontal space,
or even the trees themselves [@hanburybrown_forest_2022].

## Research recommendations

Increasing complexity in establishment modules has been motivated by
better process understanding and enhancing of model accuracy
[@bugmann2022; @bugmann2019]. However, more complex models do not
necessary lead to better projections and rather to a reduced
transparency and predictive power [@franklin2020]. The results from this
study showed that increasing complexity in the establishment modules did
not represent an improvement in the projections of ingrowth levels,
species composition or mortality at early tree stages. Thus, the
question what level of detail one has to use to model establishment
processes remains open and must be addressed in future research
[@konig_tree_2022; @bugmann2022].

If it should be adequate to include more detail in the establishment
models, this will come with higher parameterisation efforts, which will
most likely lead to lower generalization as the required data will have
to be collected from specific locations, as there is no general
establishment dataset available. We recommend on the one hand that the
further development of the establishment modules is implemented as
additional features that can be traced back, as done in this study for
the model variants of ForClim and ForCEEPs, and that model complexity
and structure must always be connected with model objectives
[@albrich2020]. On the other hand, we emphasize that datasets like
EuFoRIa used here are invaluable and should be further expanded in both
their spatial extent (e.g., towards boreal and Mediterranean conditions)
as well as in time (e.g., continuing the monitoring into the future).

Based on the results of this study, it is clear that models of forest
dynamics need a focus on their establishment modules. However, here we
have only consider tree establishment in the equilibrium state. It is
equally important to understand how these models project tree
establishment after changes in forest structure like those brought about
by disturbances [@seidl2022], or under different management strategies
[@lindner2000]. However, this will require an entirely different set of
observed data, and potentially not all models of forest dynamics would
be able to assess the relationship of these aspects on tree
establishment, e.g., due to the lack of disturbance or appropiate
management modules.

We recommend to further investigate the implications of the current
modeling strategies for tree establishment, particularly those related
to excess tree establishment and probably late excess mortality, by
focusing on a wider range of tree sizes and the related ingrowth
dynamics. We also recommend, especially for the landscape-level models,
the inclusion of explicit spatial considerations regarding tree ingrowth
[@beckage2003]; this, however, is facing a serious challenge regarding
appropriate data sets, as inventory data have wide coverage, but do not
allow for the assessment of spatial interaction effects.

## Conclusions

Models of forest dynamics are important tools in science and decision
support, and how tree establishment is defined has strong implications
for simulated forest properties. The 15 models and variants used here
are facing similar challenges when representing tree establishment. They
generally overestimate tree establishment rates, and the simulated
establishment niche is not always captured accurately as a function of
the biotic (light) and abiotic (temperature and moisture). However, most
models properly capture the diversity of the initial tree populations,
although changes in their formulations including feedback from adult
trees did not have an effect on better capturing the species composition
of ingrowth.

Regarding mortality in the early phase of tree life, many models that
feature a particularly high overestimation of ingrowth levels are
compensating this by a larger tree mortality. Often, however, this
compensation is not sufficient to reduce the high ingrowth levels to
realistic values. Overall, however, there is no clear pattern across all
models.

When capturing tree establishment, the specific design decisions taken
in the development of any model are more important for its behavior
(accuracy) than scale (stand, landscape, global), background (empirical
vs. process-based), and complexity. Having both empirical and
process-based models in our set, the empirically-based models could have
been expected to have a better performance, as they were calibrated with
inventory data, but this was not the case. Similarly, higher model
complexity does not represent an improvement for capturing tree
establishment.

Even though the establishment routines of most of the models
investigated here have never been sufficiently constrained by robust
data, the ingrowth projections are not overly off. This indicates that a
lot can be gained by a focus on the modeling of establishment processes.
The representation of forest dynamics in these models would become much
more robust particularly in the face of climate change and
post-disturbance dynamics, thus strongly reducing the uncertainty in
long-term projections of future forest dynamics.
