# Abstract

*Regeneration is a key process in forest dynamics. Models of forest
dynamics have been long lagging an assessment in their capacities to
properly represent this process. Using 13 models of forest dynamics at
the stand, landscape and global levels, we simulate the regeneration
across 200 sites representing environmental gradients across Europe. The
outputs were compared with regeneration data collected from forest
reserves across Europe. In this study we wanted to asses how well are
models of forest dynamics capturing regeneration levels and what can be
changed to improve this. The results show that most of the models
over-estimate regeneration values. However most of them got right trends
in regeneration across temperature and precipitation gradients. Stand
species richness was better capture than recruitment species richness.

# Introduction

Forest recruitment is fundamental for forest dynamics, in particular
with increasing disturbance under climate change and it is also crucial
understand the forest resilience under climate change.

In comparison to recruitment, growth and mortality responses to climate
change are much more studied

Tree recruitment depends on several processes (reproduction, fruit
maturation, seed production, dispersal, germination, juvenile growth and
survival) that are all difficult to assess

Regeneration processes in dynamic forest models

Consequences of over recruit

Species richness in regeneration, mortality and regeneration levels
impacts on forest dynamics

This is the first time, a large number of forest models commonly used to
assess forest dynamics under climate change is evaluated against a
continental-scale multi-species harmonized data set on tree recruitment.

In this study wanted to answer the following questions:

1)  Are models of forests dynamics capturing correctly regeneration
    levels across environmental gradients

2)  Are models of forest dynamics representing correctly initial
    composition of tree populations

3)  Can models of forest dynamics correctly capture the initial
    mortality in tree in-growth between 7 and 10 cm

# Material and methods

A total of 15 models and model variants of forest dynamics at the stand, landscape and global level were used to simulate stand dynamics and sample regeneration in 200 sites selected across Europe.

About the models The models ( Table @ref(tab:tableModels)) were created with different philosophies to represent regeneration. Three models, LPJ-GUESS, the two variants of ForClim and Treemig simulated more species than the one asked because XXXX , these species were assigned to "other" category in the case of TreeMig and in the case of LPJ-GUESS they were removed from the outputs as they are shrubs species (Boreal evergreen shrub, Juniperus oxycedrus and quercus coccifera) LPJ-GUESS also simulate Corylus avellana but only had 3 trees across all samples and they were removed because due to the low degrees of freedom it was not possible to create a model for the category "others" for this model). Forclim simulated a total of 17 species more than the species asked in the protocol . Observed data also have a category others.

About the sites The sites represent the available range of environmental gradients in temperature and precipitation (Figure using the variables degree day and water balance. The sites were selected across a network of plots that collect information on forest reserves [@kaber_sheltered_nodate]

Each modeler group was provided with detailed information on how to perform the simulations including the input variables such as soil or climate, simulation setup and expected output variables. The overarching goal of this simulations was the assessment of the regeneration niche as it arises from empirical data analysis vs. its representation in a wide range of models of forest dynamics.

A GAM model based on XXX was used to compare the trend on the observed data and the simulated outputs. DESCRIBE GAM

Species simulated:  4C only simulated 4 species. Treemig. ForClim and Empirical data have more species assigned all together into category "others". LPJ-GUESS simulated bushes that were not consider in the output of speces composition neither recruitment.

ToDo add a map with the species composition of the empirical data

ToDo check in Haralds paper which models are in which category in the classification of establishment and link this with the results we see here in structure and complexity. For example iLand and Picus have a similar structure but results are very different. Are we meeting the expectations in behaviour fromthe different models?

Species composition in regeneration

We evaluated the species compositions across models and in relation to the observed data by calculating the Shannon index that defines the relative frequency of species referring to basal area (BA) (Equation @ref(eq:shannon))

\begin{equation}
H_n = - \sum_{i = 1}^{s}{p_{i}ln(p_{i})}(\#eq:shannon)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
p_{n,i} = \frac{BA_{r_{n,i}}}{BA_{total_{n}}}(\#eq:piShannon)
\end{equation}

where, $s$ is the total number of species in the sample $n$ (11 for the models that simulated all the species and a varied number for those models that did not consider all the species (see Table @ref(tab:tableModels) for more details in the simulated species); $p_{i}$ is the proportion of the species $i$ calculated as the recruited basal area ($BA_{r_{n,i}}$) for that species $i$ over the total basal area ($BA_{total_{n}}$) of that sample $n$.

Main hypothesis:

The recruitment species richness is driven by the simulated adult trees species richness and this is defined on how models represent individual species recruitment per site with respect of adult proportion

Environmental gradients have an impact on the recruitment of the 5 main tree species but extremes are not well captured

Models can capture the relative abundance of recruitment of the 5 main European tree species but they are not doing a good job for minor species

We evaluate the species composition in the recruitment and for all the trees present on the site using the relative frequency of species referring to basal area with the Shannon index calculated per sample, site and model. The higher the value, the higher the diversity of species in a particular site and sample.

Mortality in recruitment

Main hypothesis:

the higher regeneration at threshold of 7cm the stronger is the regeneration mortality, so we will see a larger decease in stem number between recruitment at threshold of 7 cm and 10 cm (as ratio nn7/nn10 (colname nn710))  In othwr words the number of individuals would decrease (Reineke self-thinning rule: This is usually calculated from even age, single species stands. The models could also include the effects of canopy shading and species competition)

Species composition it is also reduced between 7 and 10 cm

Comments on the Reineke rule

the number of individuals would decrease (Reineke self-thinning rule) from 7 to 10cm

assumes a relationship between the number of stems and the quadratic mean diameter in fully stocked pure stands.

This rule is extensively used for management purposes, but it has been initially calibrated for pure, even-aged stands for relatively few species.

This is usually calculated from even age, single species stands. The models could also include the effects of canopy shading and species competition.

Explanations:

$$Reineke exp rk=-1.605: (7/10)^{(-1.605)} = 1.77$$

# Results

## Regeneration levels

-   Recruitment was overestimated across models both for 7 and 10 cm
    diameter thresholds, with the exception of SYBILA and Landis II that
    underestimated recruitment (Figure \@ref(fig:over)). The models with
    higher overestimation are PICUS and TreeMig. The variability across
    sites in recruitment levels is similar or smaller to the observed
    variability for most of the models, with the exception of PICUS and
    TreeMig where the mean recruitment variability is larger.

    ```{r over, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Mean recruitment values across samples for the 200 sites. The red dotted lines shows the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles for the 7cm diameter threshold", out.width='100%'}
        knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures", "recOverAll710.png"))
    ```

-   Models reproduce better the dominating effect of basal area than
    effect of environmental gradients where they have varying effects
    (Figure \@ref(fig:nvTrend710BA), \@ref(fig:nvTrend710BA500) and
    FigureS 1-4). In the observed data the pattern shows that with
    increasing stand basal area the recruitment decreases, this trend
    was captured by Landis II but showing different values of basal area
    for the decreasing. Other models showed different trends such as (1)
    an increase in regeneration with increasing total basal area
    (ForCEEPS, ForCEEPS(f), FORMIND and LPJ-GUESS), (2) a rather
    constant regeneration levels with changing stand basal area (ForClim
    11, xComp, LandClim and aDGVM2) or (3) an increase of recruitment
    until certain value of stand basal area and after that a decrease in
    recruitment, but with different stand basal area thresholds (4C,
    ForClim 1, PICUS, SYBILA and iLand).

-   There are 35 sites that had a diameter threshold of 10cm and
    therefore we do not know what was the recruitment for those sites at
    7cm in the observed data, however the models did simulate
    recruitment for the 7cm threshold on those sites. The Figures
    \@ref(fig:nvTrend710BA), \@ref(fig:nvTrend710BA500) and FigureS 1-4
    show the recruitment from the diameter threshold of 7cm and those
    sites are represented in the empirical data as zeros; this would
    explain why the empirical data has zero recruitment for the lowest
    climatic water balance and highest degree day values while models do
    have recruitment.

-   The mean stand basal area across samples and per bins did not have
    the same categories in across models and empirical data. The bins
    were created using the whole stand basal area range from all the
    outputs (both from empirical and simulated data for all models). For
    those stand basal area values where the empirical data or observed
    models did not have values we assign a zero value so this stand
    basal area categories would be visible in the plots, but this zeros
    are actually not that the recruitment was zero but that this stand
    basal area category was not present for that model. This would
    explain why for the lowest stand basal areas the empirical data has
    no recruitment of for example why ,

```

## Species composition in regeneration

-   Most models increase or maintain diversity and the same happens with
    the empirical sites (Figure \@ref(fig:H710))

-   In most of the models there are small differences across sites on
    the species richness of recruitment between 7 and 10 cm (Figure
    \@ref(fig:H710). However three models, PICUS, LPJ-GUESS and Landis
    II had higher recruitment species richness than the empirical. The
    model 4C also has higher recruitment than the observed data, however
    this is a special case as this model only simulated 5 species, so
    the total species richness comparison is lower for this model.

    ```{r H710, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Shannon index of the recruitment calculated by basal area as the mean value across samples per site for diamter treshold of 7 and 10cm. The red dotted lines represent the 20 percentile of the observed data for the treshold of 7cm and 70 percentile of the observed data for the treshold of 10cm ", out.width='100%'}
    knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures", "H7_10.png"))
    ```

-   Most of the models are capturing well or over-predicting the species
    richness at the stand level (Figure \@ref(fig:combinedRichness) A
    and FigureS 8).

-   The models over predicting species richness at the stand level are
    all the "ForClim family" and FORMIND ] (FigureS 8)

-   Only few models under-predict the species richness at the stand
    level. LPJ-GUESS this is a global model that might not be design to
    capture well this, ForCEEPS (f), xComp, iLand and 4C that did
    simulate less species than the ones available (Figure
    \@ref(fig:combinedRichness), and FigureS 8).

-   Species composition is lower in the recruitment compared to the
    stand level, both for the observed data and simulated data and both
    for recruitment thresholds of 7 and 10 cm. (Figure
    \@ref(fig:combinedRichness)B, and FigureS 9)

-   Most of the models capture correctly the recruited species richness
    at lower values (Figure \@ref(fig:combinedRichness)B, and FigureS 9)

-   Many of the models underestimate species richness in recruitment
    (Figure \@ref(fig:combinedRichness)B, and FigureS 9)

-   Models simulating higher diversity at the stand do not have higher
    diversity in recruitment (FigureS 6 an 7).

-   Both models with feedback and without feedback from the adult trees
    underestimate species richness in recruitment (which ones have
    feedback! enumerate them)) (Appendix figure?)).

    knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures", "combined_richness.png"))
    ```

### **Looking at the recruitment share of the 5 main tree species we found that**

-   Most of the models capture right the share of basal area recruitment
    of the 5 main tree species compared to the observed data in the
    environmental gradient (Figure \@ref(fig:diff)).

-   The models differ in the way they represent the climate niche of
    individual main species (Figure \@ref(fig:diff)).

-   Some models overestimated across the whole gradient one of these 5
    main tree species (for example 4C ForCEEPS, ForCEEPS(f), LandClim,
    FORMIND) while other models overestimate more than one species such
    as Landis II, xComp, PICUS or SYBILA (Figure \@ref(fig:diff)).

-   *Abies alba* was well captured across the gradient for most of the
    models except for xComp, Picus, LanClim and LandisII that
    over-estimated the recruitment share difference. There are also some
    particularities from selected models such as the case of 4C that did
    not simulate *Abies alba* (Figure \@ref(fig:diff)).

-   *Fagus sylvatica* was mainly underestimated cross the environmental
    gradient, with the exception of 4C that overestimate this species
    across the whole environmental gradient (Figure \@ref(fig:diff)).

-   Most of the models over-estimated *Picea abies* recruitment share on
    colder sites (Figure \@ref(fig:diff)).

-   *Pinus sylvestris* and *Quercus* spp. are well capture for those
    models that have recruitment in these species, but the recruitment
    values are always lower so the range of variation is also always
    around 0 (to be confirmed!). However some models lack of recruitment
    for these species (Figure \@ref(fig:diff)).

-   The values that we are seeing are means of sample per site and mean
    across the sites included in each environmental bin. It is important
    to noticed that those groups of sites in the empirical data where
    the recruited basal area of the species was 0 and the stand
    recruited basal area for all species was also 0, the cells color is
    represented as grey (Figure \@ref(fig:diff)). The lack of value in
    the empirical data can be originated due to not recruitment in the
    group of sites or that the sites did not have recruitment values for
    7cm threshold.

    Shall we plot (Figure \@ref(fig:diff)) for 10cm in the appendix and
    remove FiguresS 10-12?

```{r diff, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Departure of each model in the representation of the main species recruitment relative abundance from the observations across the environmental gradients for a 7cm treshold. The values shown are the mean of samples per site and across sites in bins, where the range of the climatic water balance (cm) and seasonal degree-day sum (dºC) was divided in 10 bins. The point sizes represent ratio between recruited basal area of the species and the total recruited basal area for all the species. The color gradient shows the difference between the simulated and observed ratio between recruited basal area of the species and the total recruited basal area: grey cell represent areas of the envirnomental gradient in which the model had R BA share  and the empirical dara did not becuase both recruitment and stand level recruitments were equalt to zero.", out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures", "HeatEnvGrad_10circles.png"))
```

## Mortality in regeneration

**Main outcomes mortality in number of trees:**

-   There are differences across models on the mortality rate between 7
    and 10 cm (Figure \@ref(fig:mortality11)).

-   Most of the models have a mortality rate larger than those present
    in the empirical data (Figure \@ref(fig:mortality11)).

-   Several models simulate a mortality rate in recruitment that could
    be explained by the self thinning rule (Figure
    \@ref(fig:mortality11)).

-   Models below the Reineke line have lower mortality than the expected
    by self thinning rule, which might point to facilitation or higher
    mortality before the species reached 7 cm diameter (Figure
    \@ref(fig:mortality11)).

-   Values below 1 line show sites where there is a higher number of 10
    cm trees than in 7 cm- this is an artifact of the method - we expect
    space for time substitution, but in reality we just have one
    measurement (Figure \@ref(fig:mortality11)).

-   Models such as SYBILA, xComp, PICUS, LandClim amd TreeMig are above
    the self thinning line (Reineke) indicating that they have higher
    mortality in recruitment of mixed species forest than the expected
    in an even aged single species forests (Figure
    \@ref(fig:mortality11)).

-   Most of the models with lower variation in mortality between 7 and
    10cm also have lower overestimation in recruitment at 7cm (Figure
    \@ref(fig:mortality13) and FigureS 13).

-   Models with higher mortality also show higher tree recruitment at
    7cm (Figure \@ref(fig:mortality13)).

-   There might be a difference between models including stochastic
    processes in recruitment and those which don't, but perhaps the
    reality implies higher mortality rates in the adult component
    (enhance the share of less shade tolerant species?) [to the
    discussion] ((Figure \@ref(fig:mortality11) and
    \@ref(fig:mortality13)).

-   Some of the models that start at a lower number of individuals (7cm)
    have a lower decrease between 7 and 10cm dbh (ratio 7-10cm). The
    species competition and self-thinning is either not that large or it
    happened before the species reached 7cm. This pattern it is not
    consistent across models (FigureS 14-15)

-   There is an effect of the number of individuals at 7cm on the
    mortality rate. Most of the models show a positive effect
    (increasing recruitment at 7cm shows increases the mortality between
    7 and 10cm), but some models show a negative effect. The cloud point
    per models shows the differences across sites, the shape point cloud
    per model shows if the models take into account regeneration density
    when applying mortality to regeneration (FigureS 14-15) This is not
    that clear anymore when we calculate the slope of the linear trends
    per model.

# Discussion

-   Implication of models that produce very high initial densities

-   Implications of models that have lower mortality

-   The problem of correctly capturing post-disturbance recovery, how
    seed availability and climate conditions define the 15-20 years
    status of a forest. If this is not well capture by the models we can
    not really assess the impacts of disturbances on forests.

-   Range shifts retractions in species expansions because of climate
    change might not also be properly represented if we do not capture
    properly recruitment rates in the environmental gradient .

-   If the composition is not well captured then we can not assess the
    functional composition of the forest appropriately, e.g. their
    sensitive to drought or resilience to new disturbances events.

-   Species richness variations might be explained by the way each model
    considers the recruitment (e.g. in the absence of adults recruitment
    can be linked to either seed rain form elsewhere -dispersal, or to
    sees/seedling bank) Differences might also be expected between
    cohort and individual trees based models.

-   Why models with feedback also underestimate species richness in
    recruitment?

-   Is the adult forest the right forest, how is this relevant and is
    this the consequence for the correct recruitment composition? This
    is highly dependent on the model structure:

    -   Background seed Yes/no

    -   Stochastic vs deterministic

-   We do not know what happen before 7cm in the observed data and does
    not make sense to look at that in the simulated data. 7cm is a large
    sapling, consequences of not having that information to asses forest
    dynamics. Recommendations on data collection.

-   Methodological aspects: difference in observations number between
    observed data (2-4 samples per site) and the simulated data (200
    samples per site) and the implication on variability. Assumption
    equilibrium it is expected overestimation because we do not know the
    status of the observed data more certainly not in equilibrium etc

-   Observed data has much more sites without any recruitment (zero
    inflated data). Many models seem to predict recruitment in all
    sites. The zeros in the emprical data come from no recruitment and
    from tresholds larger than 10cm for some sites. Is this a
    consequence of assuming that the observed data is also in
    equilibrium. Lack of recruitment in sites an indication of
    "non-equilibrium" due to management history?

-   Why the models over predicting species richness at the stand level
    are all the "ForClim family" and FORMIND ?
