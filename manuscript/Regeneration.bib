@article{konig_tree_2022,
	abstract = {Climate change impacts on Europe's forests are becoming visible much sooner than previously anticipated. The increase in natural disturbances leads to tree mortality and raises concerns about the forest's adaptive potential to sustain vital ecosystem services. In this context, the regeneration phase is crucial and comprises the largest potential to adapt to new environmental conditions with long lasting implications. Yet, forest regeneration is particularly susceptible to climatic changes due to the many directly climate-dependent processes, such as seed production and germination but also seedling and sapling development. Models of forest dynamics ({MFDs}) are essential to describe, understand and predict the effects of changing environmental and management factors on forest dynamics and subsequently on associated ecosystem services. We review a large variety of {MFDs} with regard to their representation and climate sensitivity of regeneration processes. Starting with a description of the underlying biological processes, we evaluate the various approaches taking into account specific model purposes, and provide recommendations for future developments. We distinguish between models based on ecological principles and models based on empirical relationships. We found an ample mix of regeneration modelling approaches tailored to different model purposes. We conclude that current approaches should be refined to adequately capture altered regeneration trends. Specifically, refinement is needed for {MFDs} that rely on ecological principals, as they suffer from knowledge gaps and underrepresented processes, thereby limiting their ability to accurately simulate forest regeneration under climate change. Global vegetation models are strongly constrained by their weak representation of vegetation structure and composition, and need to include more detail regarding structural complexity and functional diversity. Models focused on timber yield often rely on strong assumptions regarding the abundance and composition of the next tree generation, which may no longer hold true with changes in climate and forest management. With the increased utilization of natural regeneration as a source of forest renewal, more dynamic representations of tree regeneration are needed. Our review highlights the necessity to increase the data basis to close knowledge gaps and to enable the adequate incor- poration and parameterization of the involved processes. This would allow to capture altered regeneration patterns and subsequent effects on forest structure, composition and, ultimately, forest functioning under climate change.},

@article{searle_tree_2017,
	abstract = {Studies that examine forest biomass dynamics often rely on long-term, spatially extensive, repeatedly measured permanent sample plots. Due to the intensive cost of sampling all trees within these plots, an arbitrary size threshold is typically imposed, which leads to only larger trees being sampled. However, it remains unclear whether the sampling of only large trees is representative of the entirety of stands of diverse sizes; the sampling of only large trees may produce biased estimates of biomass dynamics (growth, ingrowth, and mortality). Using a network of 141 permanent sample plots from Manitoba, Canada, with all trees of {\textgreater}1.3 m in height repeatedly measured, we constructed three distinct data sets, with 10 cm, 5 cm, and no diameter at breast height threshold, to illustrate that total productivity and mortality are increasingly underestimated with increasingly larger diameter at breast height thresholds. This effect is particularly significant in young stands, where productivity estimates peak at least 20 years earlier than the determined estimates under large thresholds. We highlight the need to account for smaller trees in long-term observational studies to ensure unbiased estimates of stand level aboveground biomass productivity and loss.},

@article{seidl_post-disturbance_2022,
	abstract = {Forest ecosystems are strongly impacted by continuing climate change and increasing disturbance activity, but how forest dynamics will respond remains highly uncertain. Here, we argue that a short time window after disturbance (i.e., a discrete event that disrupts prevailing ecosystem structure and composition and releases resources) is pivotal for future forest development. Trees that establish during this reorganization phase can shape forest structure and composition for centuries, providing operational early indications of forest change. While forest change has been fruitfully studied through a lens of resilience, profound ecological changes can be masked by a resilience versus regime shift dichotomy. We present a framework for characterizing the full spectrum of change after disturbance, analyzing forest reorganization along dimensions of forest structure (number, size, and spatial arrangement of trees) and composition (identity and diversity of tree species). We propose four major pathways through which forest cover can persist but reorganize following disturbance: resilience (no change in structure and composition), restructuring (structure changes but composition does not), reassembly (composition changes but structure does not), and replacement (structure and composition both change). Regime shifts occur when vegetation structure and composition are altered so profoundly that the emerging trajectory leads to nonforest. We identify fundamental processes underpinning forest reorganization which, if disrupted, deflect ecosystems away from resilience. To understand and predict forest reorganization, assessing these processes and the traits modulating them is crucial. A new wave of experiments, measurements, and models emphasizing the reorganization phase will further the capacity to anticipate future forest dynamics.},
