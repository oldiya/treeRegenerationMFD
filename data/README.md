# Tree recruitment in Central Europe: observed and simulated data

The research data provided includes both observed data (in the 'observations' folder) and simulated data (in the 'simulation_results' folder) on tree recruitment across 200 sites in Central Europe. This data is linked to the publication titled "Tree regeneration in models of forest dynamics: a key priority for further research" by Díaz-Yáñez et al. in Ecosphere. 

The data has to be downloaded into this folder from:  https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000643426 via this link you can download the folders observations and simulation_results,  these two folders should be placed under the folder data in of this project

## Folders

### observations/

The observations were obtained from a network of sites located within forest reserves that represent the range of environmental gradients in temperature and precipitation in Central Europe. The observational data consists of derived variables obtained from forest data collected by the EuFoRIa Network members ([www.euforia-project.org](http://www.euforia-project.org/)). Käber et al. 2023 provide a detailed description of this data; this study can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.14181.

### simulation_results/

The data that was generated for this study is a result of simulations from 15 different models of forest dynamics. For more detailed information on how this data was simulated, please refer to the protocol titled "A protocol for simulating and evaluating tree regeneration using a diverse range of forest dynamic models" by Díaz-Yáñez, Olalla, Yannek Käber, and Harald Bugmann, which can be found at https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/CZDXP. You can also refer to the original publication of this research data titled "Tree regeneration in models of forest dynamics: a key priority for further research”.Díaz-Yáñez et al. in Ecosphere.

## Data variables 

The datasets containing the following variables:

–*sample*: this will identify the different samples per site (1:n, with n≥200)

–*site*: site identifier (1:200)

–*species*: species simulated with the following categories:

* fasy (for Fagus sylvatica)
* pabi (for Picea babies)
* abal (for Abies alba)
* cabe (for Carpinus betulus)
* tico (for Tilia cordata)
* acps (for Acer pseudoplatanus)
* betu (for Betulaspp.)
* frex (for Fraxinus excelsior)
* quer (for Quercus spp.)
* algl (for Alnus glutinosa)
* pisy (for Pinus sylvestris)

–*r.trees*: the recruits (trees ha−1) per species and decade

–*r.ba*: the recruits’ basal area (m2 ha−1) per species and decade

–*ba*: total basal area (m2 ha−1) per species and decade

–*dbh*: diameter threshold (cm) used to define the recruitment (7 or 10 cm)

 

The observed data also include the following variables:

-*dds*: the annual degree-day sum

-*wb*: climatic water balance
